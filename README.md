# A4-413
binary-search tree implementation 

# instructions

simply run "make" in the directory that the makefile resides in

from here you'll get examples of each traversal of the tree with each data type
in this case Int and String are utilized.

#for test cases 
run make test after running make


You will also get a png generated image of said tree but only of the Int tree :]
